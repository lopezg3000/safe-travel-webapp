##About Us Safe Travel was developed in 2021 during the Kennesaw State/Digital Crafts Flex June Cohort. A year and a half of quarantines, isolation, mask mandates, illness, vaccinations, lost loved-ones, and a looming researgence of Covid cases due to the Delta Variant, began to take a tole on the mental wellness of society and made the future seem bleak.

It became more important than ever to have infusions of joyous and happy experiences and since travel provides that infusion for many people, Gabriel, Julia, and Carmen wanted to help people experience joy by helping them make informed travel decisions. Thus "Safe Travel" was created. The purpose of this site is to provide location specific details about travel restrictions, vaccination rates, covid cases, and more.
